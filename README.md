# Pollution-Free Zone Finder

1. **Interactive Map Interface:**

   - Upon accessing the Pollution-Free Zone Finder, users are greeted with an interactive map interface displaying various regions and their corresponding Air Quality Index (AQI) levels.
   - Users can zoom in/out and pan across the map to explore different areas and neighborhoods.
   - The map interface is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing for seamless navigation and interaction.

2. **Search Functionality:**

   - Users have the option to search for specific locations using a search bar or by entering geographical coordinates.
   - Alternatively, users can opt to use their device's GPS location for personalized results, providing real-time information tailored to their current whereabouts.

3. **Color-Coded Markers:**

   - Each location on the map is marked with a color-coded indicator representing its AQI level.
   - Green markers signify areas with good air quality, indicating minimal pollution levels and optimal conditions for healthy living.
   - Yellow markers denote moderate AQI levels, suggesting a slight increase in pollution levels that may pose mild health risks to sensitive individuals.
   - Red markers highlight areas with unhealthy air quality, signaling elevated pollution levels that could have adverse effects on public health.

4. **Detailed Information:**

   - Clicking on a marker reveals detailed information about the AQI level of the corresponding location.
   - Users can access comprehensive data on the pollutants measured, including particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
   - The interface provides clear explanations of the health implications associated with each AQI level, offering guidance on potential health risks and recommended precautions.

5. **Additional Features:**
   - Users can customize the map display settings to filter AQI levels based on their preferences, such as viewing only green zones or excluding red zones.
   - The interface may include a legend or key to help users interpret the color-coded markers and understand the corresponding AQI levels.
   - Integration with real-time data sources ensures that the map reflects the most up-to-date information on air quality, allowing users to make informed decisions about their surroundings.
